 -- John Carr <john.carr@isotoma.com>  Sun, 29 Aug 2010 12:15:11 +0100

hello (2.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified doc/Makefile.in to avoid /usr/share/info/dir.gz.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Aug 2009 13:05:52 +0200

hello (2.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed prerm and postinst as they are no longer needed.
  * Added dependency on "dpkg (>= 1.15.4) | install-info".
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.3.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Aug 2009 17:01:36 +0200

hello (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. License is now GPLv3 or later.
  * Manual is included again, as it's now GFDL without invariant sections.
  * Clarified manual: If more than one of the greeting options is specified
    (`-g', `-n', `-t', and their long-named equivalents), whichever comes
    last takes precedence. Closes: #457941.
  * Don't pass -isp to dpkg-gencontrol, as it's deprecated. Closes: #508833.
  * Changed source URL in copyright file to use http, not ftp.
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.2 (no changes for this).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon, 03 Aug 2009 23:34:18 +0200

hello (2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed all traces of checkroot. It's not really debian/rules job,
    and the binary target will fail anyway if not invoked as root,
    as there is a chown call.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Apr 2007 08:05:12 +0200

hello (2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

hello (2.1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified Makefile.in to make sure that install-info is never called
    during the build. This is a workaroud for an automake bug which makes
    packages to contain /usr/share/info/dir.gz.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Oct 2002 21:07:42 +0200

    only of interest for historical reasons.
  * Lintian 1.8.2 clean.

 -- Adam Heath <doogie@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Sep 1999 10:25:13 -0500

hello (1.3-14.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * YANMU.
  * This release has no lintian errors, so that the slink release
    won't be delayed.  :)
  * Added man page(written by rcw@irc.debian.org#debian).
    (Fixes Bug#4341)

hello (1.3-14.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Yet another non-maintainer release
  * Removed source and diff targets (#14601). I'm not removing the comment
    (which would fix #14602) as it's harmless and slightly interesting IMO.
  * Fixed calling of make install; I ignored this bug last time as I didn't
    understand it. Having realised what it meant, I agree that it needed
    changing (#4967)

 -- Mark Baker <mbaker@iee.org>  Sun, 16 Nov 1997 18:11:03 +0000
